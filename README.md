# Drone Controller

University project for MobServ class at Eurecom.

The purpose of the project is to build a client-server application that allows to send remote commands between Android devices, having one (or more) of them onboard on drones.
The server is a simple chat server in Python/Twisted, and the client is an Android app that sends/receives messages and performs actions described there.

Supported features so far are requests of gps position, photo shooting and live streaming.

Potential new features include a remote pilot for the drones.
